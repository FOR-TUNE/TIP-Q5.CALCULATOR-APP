# tip_calc_app

A new Flutter project.

This project is my starting point for my Flutter application growth.
In this project, i began the implementation of the skills i learnt from classes taken to develop the User Interface for a Tip Calculator.
This tip calculator is used to calculate the amount of tip and total amount payable at a service center based on a specified percentage.
This app also caters for the amount payable by each individual of a group responsible for making payment.

This is my First Flutter project.
